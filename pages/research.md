#### <u>Langendorff perfused Heart</u>
*Retrograde perfusion of the live heart by the way of Langendorff is a simple and elegant preparation to guarantee coronary flow while providing a blood-free canvas for optical mapping. Assessment with high temporal and spatial resolution using optical mapping is the most advanced and rigorous measurement of cardiac electrophysiology currently feasible by todayâ€™s technology. We use it in our lab to study the toxicological effects of plasticizing compounds and investigate ionic imbalances associated with ischemia.*
