As a Research Technician for Dr. Nikki Posnack at [Children's National Medical Center](https://childrensnational.org/research-and-education/sheikh-zayed/research-laboratories/nikki-posnack/research), I assist with experiment designs, analyze optical/ECG data, and create figures for publication.

MatLab, Python, and 3D printing are my primary tools for contributing to Dr. Posnack's research interests: investigating the influence of pharmacological and toxicological exposures on cardiovascular and autonomic function. 

<!-- His research interests include analyzing the effectiveness of treat-based incentives such as recycling and getting the mail, as well as designing new methods to protect humans from the adverse effects of rolling trash receptacles. -->
